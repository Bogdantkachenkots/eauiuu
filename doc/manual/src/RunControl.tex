\section{Writing a RunControl}\label{sec:RunControlWriting}
In most user cases, the base eudaq::RunControl can meet the requirement of the controlling flow process upon the detector system which adapts EUDAQ framework. It is still possible to overload the default behavior of base eudaq::RunControl by implemented a derived RunContorl class with overload the virtual methods which are correlated to the command sending and client status checking.\\

\subsection{RunControl Prototype}
The command methods are \lstinline[style=cpp]{Initialise()}, \lstinline[style=cpp]{Configure()}, \lstinline[style=cpp]{StartRun()}, \lstinline[style=cpp]{StopRun()}, \lstinline[style=cpp]{Reset()} and \lstinline[style=cpp]{Terminate()}. \\

The Methods \lstinline[style=cpp]{DoConnect()}, \lstinline[style=cpp]{DoDisconnect()}, \lstinline[style=cpp]{DoStatus()} are also provided for the case the derived RunControl want be informed in time by the connection changing and eudaq::Status object coming.\\


\subsection{RunControl Mode}
There are two options when making the integration among EUDAQ RunControl and other DAQ systems which do not adapt the eudaq::Producer approach and can not talk with base eudaq::RunControl.
\subsubsection{EUDAQ Working as Master DAQ}
In this case, RunControl should behave as an entrance point to the full detector system. As the base eudaq::RunControl can not manager the controlling of the non-EUDAQ slaver DAQ, users are required to implement a specific RunControl class derived from eudaq::RunControl. With overloaded virtual methods, the user RunControl not only govern EUDAQ system but also talk to non-EUDAQ component by user specific communication protocol.\\
By this approach, the user RunControl can be instanced by the standard GUI RunControl launcher (euRun).

\subsubsection{EUDAQ Working as Slaver DAQ}
In this case, the base eudaq::RunControl can be left as what it is without modification or derivation. However, the standard GUI RunControl launcher is no reusable. The master DAQ should instance an object
of eudaq::RunControl and call the correlated method whenever it want issue the command to EUDAQ subsystem and get the status report.
